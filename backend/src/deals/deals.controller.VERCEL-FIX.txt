CRITICAL FIX NEEDED:

The @UseInterceptors with diskStorage is evaluated at MODULE LOAD TIME.
This causes the error even before any request is made.

We need to:
1. Remove @UseInterceptors decorators from create() and uploadDocuments()
2. Make these endpoints return error messages instead

Lines to fix:
- Line 164: @UseInterceptors in create()
- Line 252: @UseInterceptors in uploadDocuments()

Quick fix: Comment out the entire @UseInterceptors(...) blocks
